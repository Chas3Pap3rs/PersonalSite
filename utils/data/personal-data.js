    description: "My journey into development began with a deep curiosity for technology, leading me to build websites and explore programming long before pursuing formal education. Over time, I expanded my expertise into both frontend and backend development, working with Java, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, while integrating RESTful APIs and authentication systems to create scalable, data-driven applications. Whether working on playful web applications or complex simulations, I’m driven by continuous learning and innovation, always striving to stay ahead of development trends.",
    about: "From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by technology and its potential to change the world. My path hasn’t been traditional, but that has only fueled my passion for learning and problem-solving. I’ve worn many hats outside of development, among them — Artist, Realtor, and Technical Coordinator — each role providing unique experiences and perspectives that have shaped my ability to create intuitive and impactful digital experiences. This is something I strive to refine every day. I’m currently seeking opportunities to collaborate with a team of talented developers to build innovative applications and solve complex problems.",
